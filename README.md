What is MoonDEX?
----------------

MoonDEX is a high speed and high capacity decentralized cryptocurrency exchange, implementing Masternode technology.

With the rising of cryptocurrencies, the current mainstream exchanges still did not utilise the decentralized nature of the blockchain technology. Many centralized exchanges were hacked in 2017, leading to the loss of tens of millions of USD.

Decentralized exchanges can solve the safety issues. Because they do not normally hold the fund. However, most of the current decentralized exchanges are slow and hard to use, even for tech-savvy. As early traders and adopters ourselves, we experienced missing good trade prices due to the slow deposit, losing funds and etc. It is time to say goodbye to the pains.

Implementing the Masternode technology, we are able to build a truly decentralised system and archive high speed at the same time. There is no single point of failure. The exchange users have control of their coins.

The main focus of MoonDEX is to archive the performance of the traditional centralised exchange while providing top-level security for our users. We will build a fast, secure and easy to use platform for peer to peer cryptocurrencies exchanging.
